# flutter_native_pip_mode

🚀 Just Built a Native PIP (Picture-in-Picture) Feature! 🎥✨

Excited to share how we implemented native PIP functionality in our Flutter app! 🛠️📱

🔹 What We Achieved:
✅ Seamless PIP Mode – Runs even when minimized!
✅ Custom Aspect Ratio (3:4 Portrait Style) 📐
✅ Fixed Window Size (300x400) for consistency 📏
✅ Android Oreo+ Support (API 26+) 🔝

🔹 Tech Stack:
📌 Flutter + Kotlin for native Android integration
📌 MethodChannel for Flutter ↔ Native communication
📌 PictureInPictureParams for precise control

🔹 Why It Matters:
🎯 Enhances UX for video/map apps (like Rapido!)
🎯 Boosts multitasking efficiency
